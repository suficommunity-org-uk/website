    If you are able to contribute any extra funds to help others attend the
    workshop, please do! Thanks to contributions from previous attendees, we
    were able to offer scholarship positions for people who otherwise would not

    relationships are healing as a result!<br>

    If you wish to contribute to the scholarship fund, please indicate that in
    the "notes" section of the bank transaction and reply to this email to let

    Lodging: once we receive your registration, we will reserve a room for you.
    Double ensuite rooms are available but go very quickly, so if you need one
    of those, please send your deposit asap. We will not be holding any rooms
    without a deposit, thank you. <br>

    Food: If you have indicated dietary specifications in your registration
    form, we will note them and do our best to accommodate all your food needs
